## Introduction
**Friendlify** is a social music-sharing application that enhances the Spotify experience by allowing users to log in, showcase their music profiles, and engage with friends through features like playlist exploration, a "Surprise Me" song roulette, song ratings, and comments. It was created to address the lack of deep social interaction within Spotify, providing a platform for users to discover new music, share evolving preferences, and bond over shared interests. By fostering collaborative discovery and feedback, this project solves the problem of disconnected music-sharing experiences and is a fun, interactive, and useful tool for music lovers seeking to connect with friends through music.
