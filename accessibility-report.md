# Accessibility Report  

## Principles of Universal Design  

1. **Simple and Intuitive Use**  
   - The application is designed with clear navigation through user profiles, playlists, and a "Surprise Me" feature. These elements make it straightforward for first-time users to find and enjoy its functionalities without prior technical expertise.  
   - Features such as consistent layout, recognizable icons, and logical groupings of related options ensure that the application aligns with user expectations and reduces the learning curve.  
   - To further enhance this principle, incorporating tooltips, guided tutorials, or an onboarding experience to explain how to utilize key features would make the application even more approachable for all users, including those who might be less tech-savvy.  

2. **Low Physical Effort**  
   - The app minimizes the need for extensive navigation or interaction by providing streamlined features like a "Surprise Me" button, which enables users to discover new music without excessive searching or scrolling.  
   - Simple gestures, such as swiping or tapping, reduce repetitive actions, contributing to an effortless user experience for individuals with limited mobility.  
   - To improve further, ensuring full compatibility with voice-controlled devices, screen readers, and keyboards would make the application more accessible for users with physical limitations, reducing the reliance on touch-based interaction.  

3. **Size and Space for Approach and Use**  
   - The application is designed for standard mobile and desktop interfaces, making it accessible across commonly used devices. Its default settings cater to most users, ensuring a familiar experience.  
   - However, responsive design improvements, such as adjusting layouts to accommodate larger font sizes or providing adequate spacing for users who rely on touchscreens or screen magnifiers, would enhance usability for individuals with visual impairments.  
   - Providing customizable interface options, such as adjustable button sizes and layouts, would ensure the app remains functional for users with varying levels of dexterity or those using assistive devices.  

## Target Market  

We would market our program toward users across all age groups who use Spotify, as music and sharing it with friends is a universal experience. 
The application appeals to music enthusiasts who enjoy exploring personalized playlists, discovering new tracks, and connecting with others through shared tastes. 
Young adults and teens might be particularly drawn to the social aspects, such as collaborative playlists or sharing songs with friends. 
At the same time, older users could appreciate its simplicity and features like "Surprise Me" that streamline music discovery. The design ensures inclusivity for both casual listeners and those deeply invested in their musical journeys.  

## Demographics Less Likely to Use  

Certain demographics may face barriers to using the program, including children and seniors. 
Children might lack access to Spotify accounts or the knowledge required to navigate applications independently. 
Seniors, while increasingly adopting technology, may encounter challenges in learning how to use newer platforms or in adapting to intricate features without guidance.  

To address these potential exclusions:  
- **For children:** A simplified, child-friendly version with parental controls and age-appropriate content could encourage safe and independent exploration of the app.  
- **For seniors:** Clear, large fonts, voice-guided navigation, and accessible tutorials tailored for their needs could make the app more inviting.  

These considerations align with the principles of embedded ethics by ensuring our program is inclusive and mindful of the needs of diverse demographics. 
By proactively addressing these challenges, we can strive to make the app accessible and enjoyable for as many users as possible.
