## Target Market  

We would market our program toward users across all age groups who use Spotify, as music and sharing it with friends is an experience that can be enjoyed by the majority. 
Sharing music with friends fosters connection and community, appealing to a broad spectrum of users regardless of age, culture, or lifestyle.
The application appeals to music enthusiasts who enjoy exploring personalized playlists, discovering new tracks, and connecting with others through shared tastes. 
Adolescents, adults and seniors can be particularly drawn to the social aspects, such as collaborative playlists or sharing songs with friends. 
At the same time, they could appreciate its simplicity and features like "Surprise Me" that streamline music discovery. The design ensures inclusivity for both casual listeners and those deeply invested in their musical journeys.  

## Demographics Less Likely to Use  

Certain demographics may face barriers to using the program, including children and seniors. 
Children might lack access to Spotify accounts or the knowledge required to navigate applications independently. 
Seniors, while increasingly adopting technology, may encounter challenges in learning how to use newer platforms or in adapting to intricate features without guidance.  

To address these potential exclusions:  
- **For children:** A simplified, child-friendly version with parental controls and age-appropriate content could encourage safe and independent exploration of the app.  
- **For seniors:** Clear, large fonts, voice-guided navigation, and accessible tutorials tailored for their needs could make the app more inviting.  

These considerations align with the principles of embedded ethics by ensuring our program is inclusive and mindful of the needs of diverse demographics. 
By proactively addressing these challenges, we can strive to make the app accessible and enjoyable for as many users as possible.

## Ethical Considerations

While Friendlify is designed for road use, it may be less likely to attract demographics unfamiliar with or unable to access 
Spotify, such as older adults or those in regions where Spotify is unavailable. Additionally, the reliance on Spotify's API 
and data-sharing might alienate privacy-conscious users or those wary of third-party integrations. To address these concerns, transparency 
about data usage and the inclusion of alternative login methods, such as creating standalone Friendlify profiles, could help broaden accessibility.
